# Base64 encode & decode

The `btoa()` method creates a Base64-encoded ASCII string from a binary string (i.e., a string in which each character in the string is treated as a byte of binary data).

You can use this method to encode data which may otherwise cause communication problems, transmit it, then use the `atob()` method to decode the data again.
